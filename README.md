ncl_visualise
=============

opengl network visualisation and failure tool

Using a OD flow based approach simulates network dynamics incorporating 
both spatial and temporal dimensionality. Allows failures to be simulated 
using topographic measures, flow measures and spatial zones of failure, 
all of which can be set to occur at a range of predefined times or 
randomly within a time range. Outputs include time step images and stats.
